# T-rex-OC_fix
Manages OC profiles when T-rex miner creates a new DAG. This causes a lot of rejected shares for some NVIDIA 30xx series cards

Change low_oc and high_oc keybinds to afterburner OC profiles
Add "-l output.txt" as a parameter in the batch file and run the script in the same folder where the miner is.
